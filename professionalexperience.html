											<p class="left">This application is quite simple and my first attempt at using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Prism. Naturally, I had to brute force my way through a lot at first, but once I got through the 
												initial learning, I really enjoyed building this program in WPF! It very quickly won me over and it was much more intuitive for me to use than WinForms. <br/><br/>
												Another request from Engineering, the Kanban Manager Tool was designed to create clean and useful Kanban cards to be used throughout the shop. Kanban cards are a form of inventory management and once 
												a part goes below its re-order point, employees can drop off the Kanban card at the Purchasing department where it can be re-stocked and the Kanban card returned.<br/><br/>
												I developed the most of the backend and frontend of this application. Once I was finished and working on another project, one of the engineers tweaked it slightly to allow for varying colors based on the 
												part's re-order type and gave the cards a change in appearance. There were plans to connect this directly to our inventory management software, but we were never given the opportunity to do so.

											<p class="left">In this project I really focused on MVVM and creating a loosely coupled application using Prism. The purpose of this application was to create a way to populate the possible products of the 
												Build Sheet Tool. Before this, I was using a large Excel spreadsheet and reading from that to get all the information for the Build Sheet Tool. This came with its own various problems and performance issues.<br/><br/>
												Each product's information is stored using JSON so that it can be quickly read by any application. Other information, such as who has a style checked out, is stored in an Access Database. By moving away from 
												the Excel spreadsheet, I was able to modify the Build Sheet Tool to allow for retrieving previous product version information. For example, if version 2 is more expensive due to a price increase and the customer 
												has already signed for version 1, you'd want to sell them what they signed for.

															to copy, users must right click on the style in the dropdown, this is to discourage accidental copying.<br/><br/>Selecting a style to copy makes any categories in the current style equal the color of

															Next is the "Filename Format" section, users can make each filename follow same format using this method. The application will read the available properties of the parts and add them to the 
															bottom right list view. Users can click a property to add it to the filename, so when a part is exported, it will take that property of the exported part and put it into the filename. Any 
															other generic text can be added as well to separate properties. Parts that do not have a property from the filename format will throw a warning during exporting.

											<p class="left">This application was the next step for the Build Sheet Tool and was a culmination of everything I had learned with WPF and Prism. It was planned to have more features and be easier to use than the 
												first Build Sheet Tool, however, I was not given the time to complete it and was pulled away from application development in general to fill a different role in the company. I still believe it deserves some merit 
												though, since I took the jump from an Access Database to a Microsoft SQL Server and added onto some features of the first Build Sheet Tool.<br/><br/>
												I also made most of the application wide icons in Inkscape. For the other applications, I would only make the main application logo, but in this application, I wanted to create exactly the icons I wanted for each 
												use. This also gave me the ability to easily make white and black versions of each icon for swapping when the color scheme required it.

												2 - 3 weeks with a class library I made for integrating with Fishbowl. I had this library somewhat done beforehand in preperation for my applications to retrieve and update information from Fishbowl.<br/><br/>
